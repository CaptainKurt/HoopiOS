# HoopiOS
Our app was designed with the goal of curating the best social photographs in a users given geographical area. In our app, HoopiOS, users rate a photo unbiased by social media clout, personal relationships etc. by voting on the quality of instagram photos indexed solely by geographic location. Users will be able to view photos, the location where they were taken, and the photo's current score ("Re$pects" - "Disrespects"); users will also be able to view the top hoop photos in their area.

The intended audience of this app is social media and photography enthusiasts. By reaching a user base with an existing appetite for social photography via a simplistic interface, we believe that Hoop will bring great joy to its users.
<br><br>
The features that we are most proud of are our dynamic buttons, polling a wide audience based on the location of the user's phone, and community based ranking. We envision this app in the near term becoming not only a tool for users to learn about and enjoy the community around them, but also a novel form of social interaction that will reinvigorate a stagnating field. In the long term, we will consider implementing functionality allowing users to opt-in to displaying their instagram user data along with the photos pulled from the Instagram API. This would allow users to build their social media presence and find additional channels of exposure should they so desire.

Hoop was built for the 2015 HackUVA by Kurt Walker, Brian Kincade, and Sajant Anand.
